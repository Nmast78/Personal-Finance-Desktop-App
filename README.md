# Personal-Finance-Desktop-App
A windows desktop application that is designed for beginners, preteens and teenagers, to manage their monthly finances.

# About
This application was written in python using the popular graphics library PyQt5.  PyQt5 is a python plugin that uses the Qt toolkit for
creating graphical user interfaces.
The application also uses SQLite for data storage.  SQLite is a database library written in C.  I chose SQLite because it is lightweight
and doesn't require a seperate server process.
